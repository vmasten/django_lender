# Project Name
Django Book Lender

**Author**: Vince Masten
**Version**: 1.0.2

## Overview
An HTTP server built in Django that allows for the creation of a user account and the storing of books in a database. Currently in development.

## Getting Started
1. Download the repo
1. Ensure your virtual environment matches that of the Pipfile
1. Install Docker Desktop if needed, then spin up the container with docker-compose up
2. Go to localhost:8000 to create a new user, and then watch your docker-compose terminal window for the activation link. After that, marvel at the pre-created db book instances.

## Architecture
Uses Python, pipenv (with a variety of packages--see Pipfile for more information) and Django as a framework for loading and rendering the pages.
